# Matrix Security Platform - Feature Documentation Script

## Overview
This document describes three core features of the Matrix Security Platform: Self-Healing, Forensics Investigation, and Attack Reconstruction.

---

## 1. Self-Healing Feature

### What is Self-Healing?
The Self-Healing feature automatically detects vulnerabilities in your codebase and creates GitHub issues with proposed fixes. Users can review and approve these fixes, which are then applied via pull requests.

### How It Works

#### Step 1: Vulnerability Detection
- Matrix scans your repository for security vulnerabilities
- AI agents analyze the code and identify potential issues
- Each vulnerability is categorized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

#### Step 2: Issue Creation
- For each vulnerability, Matrix creates a GitHub issue in your repository
- The issue includes:
  - **Title**: Clear description of the vulnerability
  - **Description**: Detailed explanation of the security risk
  - **Affected Files**: List of files containing the vulnerability
  - **Proposed Fix**: AI-generated code changes to remediate the issue
  - **Severity Level**: Risk assessment (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

#### Step 3: User Review & Approval
- Navigate to **Dashboard → Scans → [Your Scan] → Report**
- Review the list of detected vulnerabilities
- Click on any vulnerability to see the GitHub issue
- Review the proposed fix in the issue description
- Approve or reject the fix based on your assessment

#### Step 4: Automated Fix Application
- Once approved, Matrix creates a pull request with the fix
- The PR includes:
  - Code changes to remediate the vulnerability
  - Reference to the original issue
  - Detailed commit message explaining the fix
- You can review the PR before merging

### Configuration Requirements
- **GitHub Personal Access Token** configured in Settings
- Required permissions:
  - Contents (Read and write)
  - Metadata (Read-only)
  - Workflows (Read and write)
  - Pull requests (Read and write)

### Demo Flow
```
1. Run a security scan on your repository
2. Matrix detects vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS)
3. GitHub issues are automatically created
4. Review issues in your GitHub repository
5. Approve fixes you want to apply
6. Matrix creates PRs with the approved fixes
7. Review and merge the PRs
```

## 2. Forensics Investigation Feature

### What is Forensics?
The Forensics feature allows you to investigate security incidents by analyzing scan results, tracking attack patterns, and understanding the scope of vulnerabilities.

### How It Works

#### Step 1: Access Forensics Dashboard
- Navigate to **Dashboard → Forensics**
- View all security incidents detected across your scans

#### Step 2: Incident Overview
The forensics dashboard displays:
- **Incident ID**: Unique identifier for each security event
- **Severity**: Critical, High, Medium, or Low
- **Affected Repository**: Which codebase was impacted
- **Detection Time**: When the vulnerability was discovered
- **Status**: Open, Under Investigation, Resolved

#### Step 3: Detailed Investigation
Click on any incident to view:
- **Vulnerability Details**:
  - Type of vulnerability (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.)
  - Affected files and line numbers
  - Code snippets showing the vulnerable code
  
- **Attack Vector Analysis**:
  - How the vulnerability could be exploited
  - Potential impact on your application
  - Risk assessment and CVSS score

- **Evidence Collection**:
  - Scan logs and detection timestamps
  - Related vulnerabilities in the same codebase
  - Historical data if the vulnerability was previously detected

- **Remediation Tracking**:
  - Status of the fix (Pending, In Progress, Fixed)
  - Link to GitHub issue/PR if self-healing was triggered
  - Timeline of remediation efforts

#### Step 4: Incident Timeline
View a chronological timeline of:
- When the vulnerability was introduced (if detectable)
- When it was first detected by Matrix
- All investigation activities
- Remediation attempts and their outcomes

### Use Cases
- **Post-Breach Analysis**: Understand what went wrong after a security incident
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate reports for security audits
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify recurring vulnerability patterns
- **Team Collaboration**: Share incident details with security team members

### Demo Flow
```
1. Navigate to Forensics dashboard
2. See list of all security incidents
3. Click on a Critical severity incident
4. Review vulnerability details and affected code
5. Analyze the attack vector and potential impact
6. Track remediation status
7. Export incident report for documentation
```

## 3. Attack Reconstruction Feature

### What is Attack Reconstruction?
The Attack Reconstruction feature visualizes how an attacker could exploit detected vulnerabilities by creating a step-by-step timeline of a potential attack scenario.

### How It Works

#### Step 1: Access Reconstruction View
- Navigate to **Dashboard → Scans → [Your Scan] → Report**
- Click on the **"Reconstruction"** tab
- Select a vulnerability to reconstruct the attack path

#### Step 2: Attack Timeline Visualization
Matrix generates a visual timeline showing:

1. **Initial Access**
   - Entry point: How the attacker gains access
   - Example: "Attacker sends malicious input to login form"

2. **Exploitation**
   - Step-by-step exploitation of the vulnerability
   - Example: "SQL injection bypasses authentication"

3. **Privilege Escalation** (if applicable)
   - How the attacker gains elevated permissions
   - Example: "Attacker accesses admin panel"

4. **Data Exfiltration** (if applicable)
   - What data could be stolen
   - Example: "Sensitive user data extracted from database"

5. **Impact Assessment**
   - Potential damage to the system
   - Example: "All user credentials compromised"

#### Step 3: Interactive Visualization
The reconstruction view includes:
- **Timeline Graph**: Visual representation of attack stages
- **Code Snippets**: Vulnerable code at each stage
- **Attack Payloads**: Example malicious inputs
- **Mitigation Points**: Where fixes would break the attack chain

#### Step 4: Understanding the Attack
For each stage, you can see:
- **What happens**: Description of attacker actions
- **Why it works**: Explanation of the vulnerability
- **How to prevent**: Recommended security controls
- **Code fix**: Specific code changes to prevent this stage

### Example Reconstruction: SQL Injection Attack

```
Stage 1: Initial Access
├─ Attacker sends: admin' OR '1'='1
├─ Vulnerable code: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$input'
└─ Result: Authentication bypassed

Stage 2: Data Extraction
├─ Attacker sends: ' UNION SELECT * FROM credit_cards--
├─ Vulnerable code: Same unparameterized query
└─ Result: Sensitive data exposed

Stage 3: Impact
├─ Data compromised: All user credentials + payment info
├─ Severity: CRITICAL
└─ Recommended fix: Use parameterized queries
```

### Use Cases
- **Security Training**: Educate developers on attack techniques
- **Risk Communication**: Show stakeholders the real impact of vulnerabilities
- **Prioritization**: Understand which vulnerabilities enable the worst attacks
- **Penetration Testing**: Validate that fixes actually prevent the attack

### Demo Flow
```
1. Open a scan report with detected vulnerabilities
2. Navigate to the Reconstruction tab
3. Select a SQL Injection vulnerability
4. View the step-by-step attack timeline
5. See how the attacker could exploit the vulnerability
6. Review the recommended fix at each stage
7. Understand the full impact of the vulnerability
```
